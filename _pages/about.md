# About Me

I'm Dr. Mike Ion, a postdoctoral researcher in AI and Education at the School of Information, University of Michigan. My research focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics and data science in higher education.

## Background

Originally from Los Osos, California, I completed my B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. My passion for mathematics education was ignited through various teaching and tutoring experiences, where I witnessed firsthand the transformative power of those 'lightbulb' moments in learning.

After my degrees, I embarked on a life-changing journey as a Peace Corps volunteer in Botswana, teaching at a middle school in Hukuntsi, a village in the Kalahari Desert.

## Academic Journey

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics Education at the University of Michigan, where I was honored to receive the Jones-Payne-Coxford Award for my work on understanding machine learning can be used tohelp analyze teachersâ€™ reactions to scenarios at scale. My thesis utilized large language models to analyze conversations in online mathematics learning communities, focusing on understanding the types of questions that lead to students' mathematical confusion and the different types of conceptions of derivative students held as they worked through calculus problems.

During my time at Michigan, I:
- Worked on multiple research projects involving high school and college-level mathematics education problems.
- Assisted in teaching statistics to graduate students
- Served as an editorial assistant for the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education (JRME)
- Presented and published my work at various conferences

## Current Work

In my postdoctoral role, I'm studying how to optimally support mathematics and data science education in large university courses using conversational AI systems. This research aims to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and educational practices, potentially revolutionizing how we approach teaching and learning in STEM fields.
