# About Me

 I'm Dr. Mike Ion, a lifelong learner and educator dedicated to developing systematic ways to improve instruction. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics Education at the University of Michigan. My academic journey began with bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. My dissertation, *Beyond the Classroom: Exploring Mathematics Engagement in Online Communities with Natural Language Processing*, showcases some of my work investigating the phenomenon of online mathematics learning taking place in chat-based platforms by creating and analyzing MathConverse, a novel dataset of 200,000 structured conversations from tutors and students working together on mathematics problems. This work has resulted in several peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings, including contributions to the International Journal of Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education and presentations at major conferences such as the Psychology of Mathematics Education, North America Annual Conference. I have taught for over 15 years in a wide array of subject areas and ages, ranging from mathematics courses at California Polytechnic State University to statistics at the University of Michigan, as well as international teaching experiences with middle- and high-school students in Hong Kong and Botswana. I am committed to enhancing diverse educational environments to reach students from all backgrounds and aim to advance STEM education through innovative pedagogical practices.
