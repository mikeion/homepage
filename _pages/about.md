# About Me

I'm Dr. Mike Ion, I'm first and foremost a (life-long) learner and educator which has understanding systematic ways to improve instruction

 doing research that aims to answer fundamental questions about the ways in which students and teachers interact with content in instructional environments at scale leveraging methods from machine learning and recent . I recently completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics Education at the University of Michigan. Beginning my academic journey with Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, my research interdisciplinary research at the nexus of data science applications in education, quantitative survey methodologies, and large language models. His dissertation, Large Language Models: A New Lens for Examining Mathematical Conversations at Scale, exemplifies this focus. This work has led to several peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings, including contributions to the International Journal of Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education and presentations at major conferences like the Psychology of Mathematics Education, North America Annual Conference. Mike's teaching experience is extensive, ranging from mathematics at California Polytechnic State University to statistics at the University of Michigan, along with international experiences with middle- and high-school students in Hong Kong and Botswana. Committed to enhancing diverse educational environments to reach students from all backgrounds, he aims to enhance STEM education through innovative pedagogical practices.
