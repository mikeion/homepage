Hello and welcome to the first post on my website's blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts, learnings, and insights from my journey exploring the fascinating worlds of mathematics, programming, statistics, mathematics education, and machine learning.

As I update my website's design, I apologize for the current bare appearance. But rest assured, soon, it'll be revamped to better reflect and support the ambiance we are building here together.

Through this blog, I aim to create a space where we can discuss and engage in meaningful conversations at the intersection of these inspiring fields. I will share new ideas, concepts, and trends that I encounter as I read various books, articles, and studies.

Stay tuned for posts full of musings, discussions, and reflections!
