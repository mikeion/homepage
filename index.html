<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>

<p>I am a postdoctoral research fellow in AI and Education in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. My research interests include large language models as a tool for educational research, simulated student (and teacher) modeling, optimal practice scheduling, and ML-assisted methods for analyzing learning interaction data.</p>
